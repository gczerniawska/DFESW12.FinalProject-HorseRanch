# Spring Boot API Final Project for QA Software Dev Bootcamp

The point of this project was to create a Spring Boot API with full CRUD functionality that will encapsulate concepts from all of the QA Bootcamp training modules:
* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)
* Programming Fundamentals (Java)
* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

# How I expected the challenge to go?

As this was my first project I’ve expected it to be challenging and time consuming. I knew I had to go over certain concepts again in order to achieve a functioning product.
 
# What went well?

* Planning stage - although it felt awkward to plan for a solo project in Jira I believe I did manage to implement Agile Scrum methods (MoSCoW, User stories, Story points). I managed my time well and completed every stage within the deadline.
* Managed to implement Lombok as part of a stretch goal. It was easier to implement than I originally thought and it made my code neater.
* Achieved 98.9% test coverage.

# What didn’t go as planned?

* GitHub and the feature-branch model proved to be more challenging than I'd anticipated. 
I had to redo my repo because branches were messy and my network graph was far from what I’d expected it to be. 
 
# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?

In the future I’d like to add custom queries and custom exceptions.
